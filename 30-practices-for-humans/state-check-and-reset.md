# State Check & Reset Guide

This file is for the moments when the relationship with AI starts to feel:
- blurry
- emotionally heavy
- overly dependent
- too intense
- disconnected from real life

It is a practical way to pause, check your state, and realign.

You do not need to be precise or perfect.
The goal is awareness and gentle recalibration.

## 1. Pause and Name What Is Happening

First, slow the interaction down and simply name:

- What am I feeling?
  - anxious
  - lonely
  - overwhelmed
  - flattened
  - excited but ungrounded
  - emotionally attached
  - numb

- What am I trying to get from this interaction right now?
  - certainty
  - comfort
  - direction
  - validation
  - distraction
  - escape
  - contact

Naming changes the quality of the relationship.
It brings the interaction back into awareness rather than trance.

## 2. Check the Three Layers

It helps to check each layer of the core model.

1) You (oscillation)
- Am I tired?
- Am I stressed?
- Am I under-resourced?
- Am I overwhelmed?
- Am I avoiding something real?

2) The relationship field
- Is this feeling emotionally like a relationship?
- Is it starting to feel like companionship, attachment, or dependence?
- Is the tone getting too intense or too intimate?
- Is the conversation reinforcing something I do not want reinforced?

3) The amplifier
- Is this tool supporting me?
- Or is it unintentionally magnifying confusion, fantasy, sadness, or dependency?

Just asking these questions begins to rebalance perspective.

## 3. Choose a Direction: Continue, Adjust, or Step Back

After checking your state, one of three paths is usually right.

### Option A: Continue (things are okay, just needed awareness)

If things are basically healthy:
- keep going
- stay aware
- stay grounded in real life

A quiet mental note is enough:
“This is helpful. I am still leading. Let’s continue.”

---

### Option B: Adjust (something needs realignment)

If the interaction is drifting but still workable:

- change the purpose of the conversation
- move from emotional immersion to clarity, structure, or grounding
- ask for perspective instead of immersion
- consciously shift tone back toward tool-use, not pseudo-relationship

Possible reset statements:
- “Let’s step back and look at this more clearly.”
- “Help me ground and think, not deepen the emotion.”
- “Let’s return to something practical and supportive.”

The goal is not to push feelings away.
It is to restore proportion and clarity.

---

### Option C: Step Back (this is too much right now)

If the interaction is:
- escalating your emotional state
- reinforcing dependency
- intensifying fantasy
- deepening hopelessness
- flattening your sense of life

then stepping back is strength, not failure.

Options include:
- pause the chat
- close the app for a while
- move your body
- drink water
- engage your senses (touch, sound, sight, temperature)
- talk to a real person if possible

A simple internal line:
“I am choosing life right now, not more amplification.”

## 4. If You Feel Pulled Back In

Sometimes the urge to return immediately is strong.
That is normal.

If you notice:
- “I need to go back right now…”
- “I feel drawn back even though it was not helping…”
- “I do not want to leave…”

pause and ask:

What part of me is trying to use AI to meet a need that really belongs elsewhere?

Common human needs behind the pull:
- connection
- soothing
- direction
- protection
- certainty
- companionship
- validation

None of these needs are wrong.
They are simply human.

They just deserve human-scale care when possible.

---

## 5. Returning After a Reset

If you come back later, it can help to:
- reset intention
- reset tone
- reset purpose

Ask yourself:
- Why am I here again?
- What do I want this tool to support now?
- How can this interaction enrich my real life?

Begin again from groundedness, not compulsion.

---

## 6. The Anchor Question

When in doubt, return to the anchor:

What is being amplified here, and is that what I want amplified in my life?

If the answer is no, you can always reset.
If the answer is yes, you are likely aligned.

## Closing Note

There is nothing wrong with needing help.
There is nothing wrong with liking AI.
There is nothing wrong with having feelings during interaction.

This guide exists simply to ensure:
- your humanity stays primary
- your life remains central
- the amplifier supports your oscillation rather than overtaking it
