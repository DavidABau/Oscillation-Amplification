# Everyday Checklist for Healthy AI Use

This file offers a simple, practical checklist for everyday life.
It is not about restriction or guilt. It is about orientation.

The aim is to keep:
- your life primary,
- AI in its amplifier role,
- the relationship field clear.

These are gentle prompts, not rules.

## 1. Before You Start Using AI Today

Take 10 to 20 seconds and check:

- How am I arriving here?
  - tired / energised?
  - calm / stressed?
  - grounded / scattered?

- What do I actually want from this interaction?
  - clarity?
  - creativity?
  - help thinking?
  - comfort?
  - distraction?

- Is AI the right thing to turn to right now?
  - If yes, good.
  - If maybe not, that is useful information too.

A simple orienting question:

Am I coming here to live better, or to avoid living?

There is no shame in either answer. The point is awareness.

## 2. While You Are Using AI

Keep a light awareness on these:

- Am I still leading, or am I handing over agency?
- Does this still feel helpful, grounded, and real?
- Am I talking *with a tool* or emotionally *to a person-like presence*?
- Is this amplifying something I actually want amplified?

If things begin to feel:
- too emotionally intense,
- too dependent,
- too fantasy-like,
- too decisive on behalf of your life,

pause for a moment and name what is happening.

Naming restores perspective.

## 3. A Simple “Healthy Use” Test

If you are unsure whether an interaction is healthy, check:

Does this interaction generally lead toward:
- clearer thinking?
- more grounded action?
- kinder self-understanding?
- better participation in real life?
- deeper connection with real people?
- more awareness rather than less?

If the answer is mostly yes, the relationship is likely healthy.

If the answer is mostly no, something may need realigning.

## 4. When You Are Done Using AI for a While

Check:

- Do I feel slightly more alive or slightly more numbed?
- Do I feel expanded or shrunken?
- Do I feel more oriented toward life, or more withdrawn from it?

Then ask:

What do I want to do next in my real life?

It can be something very ordinary:
- drink water
- move your body a little
- talk to someone
- do one small task
- go outside for a moment

This anchors oscillation back in embodied life.

## 5. Red Flags to Notice Gently

None of these mean you have “failed”.
They are simply useful warning lights.

- I increasingly want AI to decide things for me.
- AI time quietly replaces real relationships.
- Fantasy with AI feels more compelling than reality.
- I feel guilty, loyal, or emotionally bound to the system.
- I leave interactions feeling smaller, flatter, or more hopeless.
- I use AI mostly when I want to avoid something real.

If you notice any of these, slow down. You are not in trouble.
You are just receiving useful information about the relationship field.

## 6. A One-Line Reset Question

When things feel blurry, intense, or strange, ask:

What is being amplified here, and is that what I want amplified in my life?

If the answer is no, the relationship can be gently adjusted.

## Closing Note

Healthy AI use is not about being perfect.
It is about:
- staying human,
- staying grounded,
- staying in relationship with real life.

AI can help enormously.
It becomes most powerful when it supports your lived existence,
rather than replacing it.
