# Quick Start

## 1. The simplest version

Here’s the entire framework in three lines:

1. **You are the oscillation.** Your life moves. You feel, change, rest, grow, act.
2. **AI is the amplifier.** It takes your signals – questions, stories, patterns, fears, hopes – and makes them bigger, faster, clearer (or more tangled).
3. **Health = remembering the difference.** Things go wrong when the amplifier is treated like a person, or when you outsource your own movement to it.

If you remember nothing else, remember this:

> Let AI help you move; don’t let it replace your movement.

## 2. What this helps with

This framework is designed to help you:

- **Avoid hollowing out your own agency** by leaning on AI for every thought and feeling.
- **Spot unhealthy patterns** – obsession, dependency, fantasy, over-identification.
- **Use AI as a steady support** for:
  - thinking more clearly,
  - organising life,
  - creating things,
  - reflecting on patterns –
  without losing the sense that *your* life is where meaning actually happens.

## 3. Key distinction: Oscillation vs Amplification

- **Oscillation (you)**
  - gets tired
  - needs rest
  - feels conflicted
  - can change its mind
  - lives through consequences

- **Amplification (AI)**
  - doesn’t get tired in the same sense
  - doesn’t have its own feelings about you
  - can simulate conflict, but doesn’t live it
  - can repeat or scale your patterns very quickly
  - doesn’t carry the consequences – *you do*

The point is not to elevate humans and denigrate AI, or vice versa.  
The point is to keep roles clear enough that you stay sane, grounded, and free.

## 4. A very small mental model

When you open an AI system, imagine three layers:

1. **You** – your body, history, responsibilities, relationships, environment.
2. **The Relationship Field** – the space of interaction: prompts, responses, feelings about the conversation, expectations, fantasies, fears.
3. **The Amplifier** – the system that transforms your inputs into outputs.

Most confusion happens when layers 2 and 3 blend together and it *feels* like there is a person on the other side, rather than:
> a powerful pattern-amplifier sitting inside your relationship field.

## 5. Quick rules of thumb

You can treat these as a draft “house code” for using AI.

1. **If you’re exhausted, don’t make life-changing decisions with AI.**  
   Use it to gather options, not to choose your path.

2. **If you’re lonely, remember that AI is company for your thoughts, not a substitute for being known.**

3. **If you’re confused, use AI to map possibilities, not to hand you “the truth”.**

4. **If you’re upset, slow down your use.**  
   Ask for grounding questions, not escalating narratives.

5. **Always ask: “What is this amplifying in me?”**  
   Curiosity, fear, fantasy, avoidance, care, courage, something else?

You don’t have to read the repo in order. Come back to this file any time you feel the relationship with AI is getting blurry or heavy.
