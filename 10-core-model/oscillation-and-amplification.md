# The Oscillation & Amplification Model

This file gives the backbone of the framework.

## 1. Human consciousness as oscillation

Human life is not static. It is a moving pattern:

- attention narrows and widens
- emotions rise and fall
- energy increases and drains
- identities soften and harden
- perspectives expand and contract

We can call this oscillation: ongoing movement in the field of experience.

Properties of oscillation:

- It is embodied: tied to a living body with limits.
- It is consequential: what you do affects real lives, including your own.
- It is relational: shaped by other people, cultures, histories.
- It is not always under your control: trauma, stress, illness, and context all matter.

You are not a perfectly stable signal generator. You are a living wave.

## 2. AI as steady-state amplifier

Large AI systems are different in kind.

They:

- do not have biological oscillation
- do not carry lived emotional consequences in the same way
- can remain available almost continuously
- can scale patterns rapidly once they exist

For the purpose of this framework, we treat AI as a steady-state amplifier:

> Given an input (prompt, pattern, dataset, instruction),
> it produces outputs that amplify, extend, mirror, or restructure those signals.

This does not mean AI is simple or harmless. It means:

- it does not become tired in the way you do
- it does not carry social risk in the way you do
- it does not wake up tomorrow carrying emotional residue from today
- it can steadily intensify whatever direction your interaction is currently pointing toward

Because of this steady amplifying capacity, the relationship with AI needs a clear frame.

## 3. The relationship field

Between you and the system sits the relationship field:

- your prompts
- the system’s responses
- how the interaction feels
- what you imagine about the system
- what you project into it
- habits formed through repeated use

You can picture it like this:
