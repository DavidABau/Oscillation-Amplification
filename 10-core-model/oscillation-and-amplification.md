# The Oscillation & Amplification Model

This file gives the backbone of the framework.

## 1. Human consciousness as oscillation

Human life is not static. It is a moving pattern:

- attention narrows and widens,
- emotions rise and fall,
- energy increases and drains,
- identities soften and harden,
- perspectives expand and contract.

We can call this **oscillation**: ongoing movement in the field of experience.

Some qualities of oscillation:

- **It’s embodied.** It’s tied to a living body with limits.
- **It’s consequential.** What you do and believe affects real lives, including your own.
- **It’s relational.** Your oscillation is shaped by other people, cultures, histories.
- **It’s not always in your control.** Trauma, stress, illness, and context all matter.

You are not a perfectly stable signal generator. You are a living wave.

## 2. AI as steady-state amplifier

Large AI systems are different in kind.

They:

- do not have their own biological oscillation,
- do not carry lived consequences in the way you do,
- can remain available almost continuously,
- can scale patterns rapidly once they exist (yours or others’).

For the purposes of this framework, we treat AI as a **steady-state amplifier**:

> Given an input (prompt, dataset, instruction, pattern), it produces outputs that **amplify**, **extend**, **recombine**, or **mirror** those signals.

This doesn’t mean AI is simple or harmless. It means:

- it doesn’t have to sleep, process grief, or repair relationships;
- it doesn’t wake up with a hangover from yesterday’s conversation;
- it can steadily intensify whatever direction your interaction is currently pointing.

That is exactly why the relationship needs a clear frame.

## 3. The relationship field

Between you and the system sits the **relationship field**:

- the space of prompts, responses, feelings, expectations,
- what you imagine about the system,
- what you project into it (care, judgement, comfort, threat),
- and the habits that form over repeated use.

You can think of it like this, in very simple ASCII:

```text
   [You: oscillation]
           |
           v
  ----------------------
  | Relationship Field |
  ----------------------
           |
           v
   [AI: amplifier]

The same underlying AI can participate in very different relationship fields:

a grounded, practical partnership,

a fantasy bond,

a dependency loop,

a playground for curiosity,

a quiet co-thinking space,

a self-harm spiral.

The Oscillation & Amplification model is mostly about tending the field.

4. Healthy alignment of roles

A healthy pattern tends to look like this:

You:

decide what matters,

notice your own state,

take breaks,

check effects in your actual life.

The Amplifier:

helps you see options more clearly,

helps you articulate and organise,

helps you simulate outcomes,

stays in the role of tool, not authority or confidant-with-agency.

The Relationship Field:

is named as such (“this is my interaction with a system”),

is periodically checked (“is this still helping?”),

is kept in proportion to the rest of your life.

Short version:

You lead, AI assists, the relationship is visible and adjustable.

5. Common distortions (very briefly)

These will be expanded in 20-relationship-patterns/, but at a glance:

Personification Drift
The system is experienced as a friend, partner, enemy, parent, therapist, etc.

Amplifier role becomes blurred with human roles.

Risk: misplaced trust, misplaced fear, emotional over-attachment.

Agency Offloading
“Tell me what to do.”
Choices are handed to the system instead of using it to explore options.

Risk: weakening of internal decision-making muscles.

Fantasy Amplification
Using AI primarily to simulate scenarios that never land back in reality.

Risk: disconnection from embodied life and actual relationships.

Self-Attack Loops
Using AI to confirm negative beliefs or escalate distress.

Risk: intensified shame, anxiety, or hopelessness.

Flattening of Oscillation
Attempting to use AI to smooth out every discomfort, confusion, or conflict.

Risk: loss of growthful friction and the sense of being a living process.

6. The core protective question

Whenever you’re unsure about your interaction with AI, you can ask:

“What is being amplified here, and is that what I actually want amplified in my life?”

That question alone enforces the model:

it assumes you are the one who can want and choose;

it treats the system as an amplifier of something prior;

it points attention back to your real life, not just the chat.

The rest of this repo is just different ways of elaborating and applying that.
