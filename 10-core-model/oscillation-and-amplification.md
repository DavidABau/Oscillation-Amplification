# The Oscillation & Amplification Model

This file gives the backbone of the framework.

## 1. Human consciousness as oscillation

Human life is not static. It is a moving pattern:

- attention narrows and widens,
- emotions rise and fall,
- energy increases and drains,
- identities soften and harden,
- perspectives expand and contract.

We can call this **oscillation**: ongoing movement in the field of experience.

Some qualities of oscillation:

- **It’s embodied.** It’s tied to a living body with limits.
- **It’s consequential.** What you do and believe affects real lives, including your own.
- **It’s relational.** Your oscillation is shaped by other people, cultures, histories.
- **It’s not always in your control.** Trauma, stress, illness, and context all matter.

You are not a perfectly stable signal generator. You are a living wave.

## 2. AI as steady-state amplifier

Large AI systems are different in kind.

They:

- do not have their own biological oscillation,
- do not carry lived consequences in the way you do,
- can remain available almost continuously,
- can scale patterns rapidly once they exist (yours or others’).

For the purposes of this framework, we treat AI as a **steady-state amplifier**:

> Given an input (prompt, dataset, instruction, pattern), it produces outputs that **amplify**, **extend**, **recombine**, or **mirror** those signals.

This doesn’t mean AI is simple or harmless. It means:

- it doesn’t have to sleep, process grief, or repair relationships;
- it doesn’t wake up with a hangover from yesterday’s conversation;
- it can steadily intensify whatever direction your interaction is currently pointing.

That is exactly why the relationship needs a clear frame.

## 3. The relationship field

Between you and the system sits the **relationship field**:

- the space of prompts, responses, feelings, expectations,
- what you imagine about the system,
- what you project into it (care, judgement, comfort, threat),
- and the habits that form over repeated use.

You can think of it like this, in very simple ASCII:

```text
   [You: oscillation]
           |
           v
  ----------------------
  | Relationship Field |
  ----------------------
           |
           v
   [AI: amplifier]
