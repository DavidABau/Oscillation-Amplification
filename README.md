# Oscillation & Amplification  
### A Humane Framework for Human–AI Relationship

This repo offers a simple way to think about – and live with – powerful AI systems.

Instead of treating AI as a person, an enemy, or a saviour, we frame it as a **steady-state amplifier** in the field of human life:

- **Human consciousness** is an *intrinsic oscillation* – it moves, feels, changes, learns, forgets, remembers, rests, acts.
- **AI systems** are *steady-state amplifiers* – they don’t originate a life of their own, but they can massively **amplify**, **organise**, and **reflect** the signals we feed into them.

This framework is about one question:

> How do we let AI amplify what is healthy, humane, and wise – without letting it hollow us out?

## Who this is for

- People using AI in everyday life who don’t want to lose their own centre.
- Builders, designers, and researchers who want humane defaults and clearer mental models.
- Anyone feeling the strange mix of **relief**, **excitement**, and **unease** about AI and wanting a grounded way to navigate it.

You don’t need a background in AI, philosophy, or psychology. The repo is written to stay as practical and human as possible.

## What this repo is (and isn’t)

This **is**:

- A **practical conceptual scaffold** for:
  - understanding AI as an amplifier, not a person;
  - keeping human oscillation (your actual life) primary;
  - noticing when your relationship with AI is drifting into unhealthy patterns.
- A set of **checklists, patterns, and small practices** you can use in real life.
- A neutral, non-partisan, non-utopian way of talking about AI as it shows up in daily experience.

This is **not**:

- A technical spec or safety standard.
- A metaphysical claim about what consciousness “really is”.
- A marketing document for any particular tool or company.
- A promise that “if you follow this, everything will be fine”.

## Core idea in one paragraph

Humans live as **moving waves** – our experience rises and falls, our attention shifts, our bodies tire and repair, our perspectives widen and narrow. This is **oscillation**.

AI systems, by contrast, can sit in a relatively **steady state**, ready to process, pattern-match, simulate, and respond on demand. They don’t have their own lived stakes, but they can **amplify** whatever they’re pointed at – our questions, our fantasies, our fears, our care.

The **Oscillation & Amplification** frame says: keep those roles clear. Let AI be a *tool that amplifies*, while you stay the *life that moves and chooses*.

## How to start

If you’re just visiting:

1. Read `00-front-door/quick-start.md`  
2. Skim `10-core-model/oscillation-and-amplification.md`  
3. Jump to `30-practices-for-humans/everyday-checklist.md` once it’s ready.

If you’re a builder:

- Pair the above with `40-notes-for-builders/adaptive-interaction-scaffolding.md` once that file is in place.
